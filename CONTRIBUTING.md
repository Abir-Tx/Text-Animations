## Adding new animations

Make sure that you are on the [**master**](https://github.com/Abir-Tx/Text-Animations/tree/master) branch of the project and then - 

- Create new folder for each animation
- Name the folder in a way that it will tell partly about the animation inside it
- Try to make the animations unique.
- You can use HTML, CSS & JS to create these animations
- If possible add a readme.md inside your folder describing what have you done and what should we expect or how to improve more or usage etc.
- Add your newly added animation in the main [README.md](README.md) docs **available animations** list.

## Improve github pages

Make sure that you are on the [**gh-pages**](https://github.com/Abir-Tx/Text-Animations/tree/gh-pages) branch of the project and then - 

- Here improve the index and styles file and folder. These two things are responsible for the main frontend of the hosted page.
- The goal of the hosted page is to show the created animations in the master branch in a nice and easily accessible way.
- You can add styles, animations, colors etc on the github pages as you like
